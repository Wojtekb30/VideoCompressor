# VideoCompressor
Compress a video file to a desired size in MB. MP4 input recommended, the result will be MP4.

This program may not work on systems other than Windows without proper code modifications.

Compressor code by 武状元 Woa (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64430805/how-to-compress-video-to-target-size-by-python ), rest by me.

The program uses FFMPEG stored in 'ffmpegprogram' folder, which is in the same directory as this program's executable file (FFMPEG included in the release ZIP).
